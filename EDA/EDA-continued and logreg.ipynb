    "3. time of emergency department registration and exit: transform into new variable - 'EDstay'\n",
    "4. 'HAS_CHARTEVENTS_DATA' - hospital admission has at least one observation in the CHARTEVENTS table, drop\n",
    "5. min, max, mean type data: because of correlation only keep mean (btw drop duplicate columns)\n",
    "6. 'INTIME', 'OUTTIME': redundant information as already have 'ICU_LOS' (**note that our record is only for the first ICU record**)\n",
    "7. `df['age'] = df.ADMITTIME.dt.year-df.DOB.dt.year`, so only keep 'age'\n",
