## Data

[MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org)
- Deidentified health data associated with ~60,000 ICU admissions (53,432 adult patients and 8,100 neonatal patients) from June 2001 to October 2012
- Includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more


## Project

### Project Objective

- Objective

- Benefits

- Data Product
    - Report (e.g. auto-generated PDF)
    - Dashboard (if time allows)


### Project Plan

- Data Plan
    - Extract, Load, Transform
    - Data cleaning, check for missing values & outliers, fix if unbanlanced data
    - EDA
    - Feature selection
    
- ML Plan
    - Different model training
    - Model selection
    - Model evaluation

- Operations Plan
    - Branches on GitHub, version control with git
    - Logging can be retrived from commits comments and ReadMe updates

- Technology Stack
    - SQL, PostgreSQL
    - AWS
    - Pandas, pyplot, seaborn, scikit-learn, dash, streamlit, etc.


### Team Member Responsibility

- Biweekly meeting and continuous cooperation
- All teammates would participate in the data exploration stage (ETL, EDA, feature selection)
- Each team member would take chage of some of the ML models in the ML exploration stage
- Would split tasks for report writing and dashboard construction (if time allows)
