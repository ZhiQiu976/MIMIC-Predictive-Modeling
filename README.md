## Data

[MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org)
- Deidentified health data associated with ~60,000 ICU admissions (53,432 adult patients and 8,100 neonatal patients) from June 2001 to October 2012
- Includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more


## Project

### Project Objective

- Purpose
    * Predict Patients' Discharge Location
    * (what is the question you tried to answer ...)

- Audience
    * Our platform aims to serve the hospital administration team, the inquisitive researchers and curious  patients
    * The multi-page dashboard serves as a tool to monitor occupancy and clinical results of patients, and provide comprehensive demonstration
    * The online ML prediction model provides real-time results of clinical outcome, which will aid in decision-making process of patients and doctors

- Benefits
    * Provide information about hospital utilizations, such as hospital bed occupancy and other key resources as a clinical decision system
    * Predict clinicians of the mortality rate of patients at the admission of hospital so health providers can be well informed as they perform clinical procedures
    * Display the predictions by dashboard and inform the clinicians of the overall trend of hospital utilizations. (if time allows)
    * Decrease the risk of adverse hospital-acquired events, and improve scheduling and satisfaction for patients
    
- Data Product
    - Multi-Page Dashboard held on Cloud Platform
    - Online ML Algorithm for Real-Time Prediction


### Project Plan

- Data Plan
    - Extract, Load, Transform
    - Data cleaning, check for missing values & outliers, fix if unbanlanced data
    - EDA
    - Feature selection
    
- ML Plan
    - Different model training
    - Model selection
    - Model evaluation

- Operations Plan
    - Branches on GitHub, version control with git
    - Logging can be retrived from commits comments and ReadMe updates

- Technology Stack
    - (can list requirement No.7 technical mastery demonstration here ...)
    - SQL, PostgreSQL
    - AWS
    - Pandas, pyplot, seaborn, scikit-learn, dash, streamlit, etc.


### Team Member Responsibility

- Biweekly meeting and continuous cooperation
- All teammates would participated in the data exploration stage (ETL, EDA, feature selection)
- Each team member would take chage of some of the ML models in the ML exploration stage
- Equally split tasks for write-up, code cleaning, dashboard construction and cloud platform deployment.
